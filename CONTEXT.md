## Project Rules
*Operational guidelines for maintaining project integrity*

1. Update CONTEXT.md after each significant change or request completion
2. All target repositories defined in config.yaml for consistent migration  
3. Fork organization and branch naming must follow config.yaml settings
4. Each project checkout will be patched for Gateway API migration
5. Comprehensive error handling with actionable suggestions required

## Technical State
*Current codebase and configuration status*

- **Files**: 13 (CONTEXT.md, README.md, requirements.txt, src/, lib/, tasks/, .gitignore, .github_token, tool.py, config.yaml)
- **Structure**: src/ directory for GitHub project checkouts with 15 repositories, lib/ directory for Python modules, tasks/ directory for Ansible task definitions
- **Git Configuration**: .gitignore prevents committing src/ contents, venv/, and Ansible artifacts
- **Authentication**: Secure token file configured, git credential prompting disabled
- **Configuration**: YAML config file with fork organization, branch settings, and build defaults
- **Automation**: Modular Python tool with lib/github_wrapper.py (924 lines) and tool.py CLI interface (1061 lines)
- **Class Architecture**: AnsibleEngine (300+ lines), BuildManager (350 lines), DeploymentManager (717 lines) for comprehensive Ansible-based workflow, build, and deployment management
- **Task System**: Ansible-based task files with 5 modular tasks (build, push, deploy, build-push, build-push-deploy) supporting native Ansible modules and playbook generation
- **Repository Setup**: All 15 required repositories forked, cloned, and configured with feature branches
- **Target Repositories**: 15 repositories successfully set up with SSH origins and repository-specific base branches
- **Multi-Repository Management**: forks-status and forks-commit commands for efficient change management
- **Build System**: Fully operational with environment variable architecture accessed through workflow system, local checkout workflow, feature branch support, and custom registry integration
- **Build System Testing**: Complete end-to-end testing confirmed - manifest pre-population, multi-stage Docker build, custom registry tagging all working
- **Build Architecture**: Environment variable-based configuration with clean separation between tool.py (configuration) and Makefile (build logic)
- **Current Architecture**: Analysis required - networking implementation unknown
- **Target Architecture**: Gateway API (migration approach to be determined)
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI ('gh'), Python 3.8+, ansible-core, PyYAML, requests, podman/docker, kubectl (for deployment tasks)
- **Testing**: Build system fully tested and operational, new classes tested for import compatibility

## Architecture Decisions
*Record significant technical decisions and rationale*

1. **Gateway API Adoption** (Planned)
   - Migration from current networking solution to Gateway API
   - Rationale: [To be documented during analysis phase]

2. **Environment Variable Build Architecture** (Implemented)
   - Makefile uses environment variables exclusively, never parses config files directly
   - tool.py reads configuration and sets environment variables before calling make
   - Rationale: Clean separation of concerns, improved maintainability, eliminates brittle YAML parsing in shell scripts
   - Benefits: Better testability, cleaner error handling, improved performance

## Known Issues
*Track bugs, limitations, or technical debt*

1. **Repository Mismatch** (✅ Resolved)
   - config.yaml defines 7 target repositories for migration
   - get_all_manifests.sh requires 15 repositories for manifest dependencies
   - ✅ Resolved by setup-forks subcommand that handles all manifest dependencies

2. **Missing Fork Repositories** (✅ Resolved)
   - Most repositories in jctanner-opendatahub-io organization didn't exist
   - Build system handles this gracefully with fast failure and helpful error messages
   - ✅ Resolved by setup-forks subcommand that creates all necessary forks with proper configuration

3. **Branch Consistency and SSH Origins** (✅ Resolved)
   - Feature branches needed to be created consistently across all fork repositories
   - Some repositories use different default branch names (main vs master vs stable vs dev)
   - HTTPS origins caused authentication issues with private/missing repositories
   - ✅ Resolved by repository-specific base branch handling and SSH origins for forks

*Immediate planned actions*

1. **Architecture Analysis Phase** (Ready to Begin)
   - Analyze current networking implementation in opendatahub-operator
   - Identify all networking components that need Gateway API migration
   - Document current Ingress/Route/Service usage patterns
   - Map dependencies between networking components

2. **Repository Dependency Management** (✅ Complete)
   - ✅ Created setup-forks subcommand to fork all 15 required repositories
   - ✅ Ensures all manifest dependencies have proper forks with feature branches
   - ✅ Addressed the gap between config.yaml repos and get_all_manifests.sh requirements
   - ✅ Implemented SSH origins and repository-specific base branch handling
   - ✅ All repositories successfully set up with correct configuration

3. **Build System Development** (✅ Complete)
   - ✅ Implemented config-driven build defaults for simplified usage
   - ✅ Troubleshot and resolved YAML parsing issues in Makefile
   - ✅ Confirmed end-to-end build functionality with local checkouts, feature branches, and custom registry
   - ✅ Full build system operational for Gateway API migration development

4. **Migration Strategy Development** (Next Phase)
   - Define Gateway API migration approach based on analysis
   - Create step-by-step migration plan with validation checkpoints
   - Establish testing strategy for networking changes

5. **Implementation Phase** (Future)
   - Begin Gateway API migration in opendatahub-operator
   - Coordinate changes across dependent repositories
   - Validate networking functionality throughout migration

6. **Validation and Testing** (Future)
   - Test Gateway API implementation in development environment
   - Verify compatibility with existing OpenDataHub deployments
   - Document any breaking changes or migration requirements
