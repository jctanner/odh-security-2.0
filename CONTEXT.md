    - Added missing permissions: services.platform.opendatahub.io (gateways) 
    - Added missing permissions: cert-manager.io (certificates, certificaterequests, issuers, clusterissuers)
    - Applied RBAC changes via kustomize build config/default | kubectl apply -f -
    - Verified permissions working via kubectl auth can-i commands
    - Controller logs show no more RBAC forbidden errors, Gateway controller operational
    - Date: Current session

43. **HTTPRoute Domain Resolution Issue Discovery** (Completed)
   - Discovered new issue after RBAC fix: HTTPRoute hostname validation errors
   - Created PROBLEM_2.md to document HTTPRoute domain variable substitution issue

   - Date: Current session

44. **cert-manager Dependency Analysis** (Completed)
   - Analyzed cert-manager usage patterns across ODH component operators (kueue, odh-model-controller, feast)
   - Created PROBLEM_4.md documenting component operator patterns vs ODH operator implementation
   - Key finding: Component operators treat cert-manager as optional with alternatives (internalcert, manual certificates)
   - Discovery: Gateway API only needs Secret with TLS certificate data - cert-manager just one way to create it
   - Root cause: Controller-runtime automatically watches any imported API types, creating hard dependencies
   - Identified three certificate management approaches: self-signed (default), manual, cert-manager (optional)
   - Recommendation: Adopt component operator pattern with self-signed certificates as default
   - Decision: Keeping cert-manager as hard dependency for now, future work to implement optional pattern

   - Automatically available through tool.py workflow system with live output streaming
   - Perfect for development iterations requiring clean deployment from scratch
   - Date: Current session

46. **Missing GatewayClass and Gateway Resources** (Completed)
   - Identified that Gateway controller is running but no GatewayClass or Gateway resources are being created
   - Created PROBLEM_5.md documenting missing resource creation in Gateway controller
   - Root cause: Gateway controller lacks actions to create GatewayClass and Gateway service resources
   - Discovery: Controller has template and cert-manager actions but missing GatewayClass creation and Gateway service resource trigger
   - Impact: Gateway API migration blocked - no actual Gateway resources for HTTPRoutes to reference
   - Requirements: Add createGatewayClass and createGatewayServiceResource actions to controller
   - Solution: Update action chain to create Istio GatewayClass and Gateway service resources automatically
   - Date: Current session

4. **Upstream Tracking**: All forks must have upstream remotes configured for rebasing

### **Repository Management**
5. **Checkout Location**: All repository checkouts must be in `src/` subdirectory
6. **Build Modes**: Support both fork repository and local checkout workflows
7. **Branch Support**: Build system must support using feature branches from config.yaml
8. **Multi-Repository**: Handle 16+ repositories that comprise OpenDataHub manifest dependencies

### **Security and Authentication**
9. **Token Security**: GitHub token stored in `.github_token` file, never committed or documented
10. **Git Authentication**: Must prevent git credential prompting to avoid hanging
11. **Fast Failure**: Repository existence checks required before git operations
12. **SSH Origins**: Fork repositories must use SSH URLs (git@github.com:) for origins
13. **Race Condition Prevention**: Delays required between fork creation and cloning operations

### **Build System**
14. **Working Directory**: Tool must work from anywhere within project directory tree
15. **Environment Variables**: Consistent use of build arguments and environment variables
16. **Command Visibility**: All build commands must show full execution details
17. **Manifest Pre-population**: Local mode must pre-populate manifests before Docker build
18. **Configuration-Driven Defaults**: All build commands must support config-driven defaults with command-line override capability
19. **Environment Variable Architecture**: Makefile must use environment variables exclusively, never parse config files directly
20. **Environment Variable Validation**: All Makefile targets must validate required environment variables with helpful error messages
21. **Configuration Separation**: tool.py handles configuration reading, Makefile handles build logic only

### **Tool Behavior**
19. **Configuration Discovery**: Automatically find config.yaml and token files in project root
20. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with helpful error messages and suggestions
21. **Repository Dependencies**: Handle missing fork repositories without hanging or failing silently
22. **Repository-Specific Branches**: Use base branches defined in get_all_manifests.sh for each repository
23. **Multi-Repository Management**: Provide commands to check status and commit changes across all repositories
24. **Clean Output**: Suppress verbose logging by default for status commands, enable with --verbose flag
25. **Status Filtering**: Support filtering repository status display to show only repositories with changes
26. **Configuration Transparency**: Show which defaults were applied from configuration versus command-line arguments
27. **Environment Variable Setting**: tool.py must set all required environment variables before calling make commands
28. **Build Environment Isolation**: All configuration values must be passed to Makefile via environment variables, not shared files

### **Ansible Task Execution**
29. **Live Output Streaming**: Ansible task execution must stream output live to stdout for debugging purposes
30. **Absolute Path Resolution**: AnsibleEngine must use absolute paths for include_tasks to avoid path resolution issues
31. **Working Directory Management**: Ansible tasks must use proper chdir arguments for commands that require specific working directories
32. **Playbook Generation**: AnsibleEngine must generate temporary playbooks with proper variable substitution and task file paths
33. **Custom Action Plugin**: live_shell action plugin must be available for real-time command output streaming

### **OpenDataHub Deployment**
34. **Namespace Separation**: Operator must deploy in opendatahub-operator-system namespace, components in target namespace
35. **Resource Names**: Use correct deployment names (opendatahub-operator-controller-manager) and API resource types
36. **Wait Conditions**: Use proper conditions for resource readiness (DSCI: Available, DSC: Ready)
37. **Configuration Management**: DSCI and DSC configurations must be centralized in config.yaml for easy customization
38. **Minimal Deployment**: Default deployment should be minimal (dashboard and workbenches only) for development
39. **Service Dependencies**: Service mesh and monitoring should be disabled by default to avoid external dependencies
40. **Cleanup Capability**: Complete cleanup must be available to remove all OpenDataHub resources including CRDs

## Negative Requirements
*Explicit constraints on what we will NOT do*

### **Documentation and Communication**
1. **No Emoji or Buzzwords**: Documentation must remain factual and professional
2. **No Automatic Documentation**: Never create README.md or documentation files unless explicitly requested
3. **No Commentary**: Keep CONTEXT.md entries factual without editorial comments

### **Security and Privacy**
4. **No Token Exposure**: Never document, log, or commit GitHub token contents
5. **No Credential Storage**: Never store credentials in code or configuration files
6. **No Authentication Prompts**: Never allow git operations that could prompt for credentials

### **Code and Build Practices**  
7. **No Iterative Fixing**: Don't loop more than 3 times fixing linter errors on same file
8. **No Parameter Invention**: Never make up values for optional parameters
9. **No Directory Pollution**: Never commit src/ directory contents to main repository
10. **No Build Context Copying**: Don't copy entire local checkouts into Docker build context
11. **No Config File Parsing in Makefile**: Never parse config.yaml or other configuration files directly in Makefile targets
12. **No Hardcoded Config Paths**: Never hardcode paths to configuration files (e.g., ../../config.yaml) in build scripts

### **Development Workflow**
11. **No Manual Processes**: Don't require manual directory navigation for tool operation
12. **No Silent Failures**: Don't allow operations to fail without clear error reporting
13. **No Blocking Operations**: Don't perform operations that could hang indefinitely
14. **No Custom Formats**: Don't use non-standard tool call formats or syntax

### **Project Scope**
15. **No Architecture Changes**: Don't modify core OpenDataHub architecture beyond networking
16. **No Breaking Changes**: Don't introduce changes that break existing functionality
17. **No Feature Additions**: Focus only on Gateway API migration, not new features

## Project Rules

## Architecture Decisions
*Record significant technical decisions and rationale*

1. **Gateway API Adoption** (Planned)
   - Migration from current networking solution to Gateway API
   - Rationale: [To be documented during analysis phase]

2. **Environment Variable Build Architecture** (Implemented)
   - Makefile uses environment variables exclusively, never parses config files directly
   - tool.py reads configuration and sets environment variables before calling make
   - Rationale: Clean separation of concerns, improved maintainability, eliminates brittle YAML parsing in shell scripts
   - Benefits: Better testability, cleaner error handling, improved performance

## Known Issues
*Track bugs, limitations, or technical debt*

1. **Repository Mismatch** (✅ Resolved)
   - config.yaml defines 7 target repositories for migration
   - get_all_manifests.sh requires 15 repositories for manifest dependencies
   - ✅ Resolved by setup-forks subcommand that handles all manifest dependencies

2. **Missing Fork Repositories** (✅ Resolved)
   - Most repositories in jctanner-opendatahub-io organization didn't exist
   - Build system handles this gracefully with fast failure and helpful error messages
   - ✅ Resolved by setup-forks subcommand that creates all necessary forks with proper configuration

3. **Branch Consistency and SSH Origins** (✅ Resolved)
   - Feature branches needed to be created consistently across all fork repositories
   - Some repositories use different default branch names (main vs master vs stable vs dev)
   - HTTPS origins caused authentication issues with private/missing repositories
   - ✅ Resolved by repository-specific base branch handling and SSH origins for forks

4. **DSCI Null Phase Issue** (✅ Resolved)
   - DSCI resource stuck in null phase, preventing OpenDataHub initialization
   - Root cause: Auth validation webhook rejecting empty AdminGroups for OpenDataHubGateway platform
   - Platform detection logic returns OpenDataHubGateway when networking.mode: "gateway-api"
   - Missing adminGroups map entry for OpenDataHubGateway platform caused empty string in AdminGroups
   - Multiple deployment issues: leader election conflicts, missing RBAC permissions, missing CRDs
   - ✅ Resolved by adding OpenDataHubGateway adminGroups entry, fixing operator deployment, and adding required permissions

5. **Gateway Controller RBAC Permissions** (✅ Resolved)
   - Gateway controller unable to watch Gateway API and cert-manager resources
   - Root cause: Missing RBAC permissions in config/rbac/role.yaml for Gateway API and cert-manager resources
   - Controller logs showed continuous "forbidden" errors for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io and certificates.cert-manager.io
   - Clean rebuild/redeploy cycles didn't resolve the issue - problem was in source configuration
   - ✅ Resolved by adding missing permissions to role.yaml and applying via kustomize

6. **HTTPRoute Domain Resolution** (🔄 Active)
   - HTTPRoute resource creation fails with hostname validation error
   - Issue: HTTPRoute created with literal $(dashboard-domain) instead of resolved domain value
   - Error: "spec.hostnames[0]: Invalid value: 'odh-dashboard.$(dashboard-domain)'" 
   - Root cause: Domain variable substitution not working for Gateway API resources
   - Impact: Dashboard Gateway API routing blocked despite controller functioning
   - Status: PROBLEM_2.md created for investigation and resolution

7. **cert-manager Hard Dependency** (📋 Analyzed)
   - ODH operator requires cert-manager CRDs and RBAC permissions even when not using cert-manager
   - Root cause: Controller-runtime automatically watches any imported API types
   - Impact: Deployment failures when cert-manager not available
   - Analysis: PROBLEM_4.md documents component operator patterns and alternatives
   - Solution: Use self-signed certificates as default, make cert-manager optional
   - Status: Keeping as hard dependency for now, future work to implement optional pattern

8. **Missing GatewayClass and Gateway Resources** (🔄 Active)
   - Gateway controller running but no GatewayClass or Gateway resources created
   - Root cause: Controller lacks actions to create GatewayClass and Gateway service resources
   - Impact: Gateway API migration blocked - no Gateway resources for HTTPRoutes to reference
   - Requirements: Add createGatewayClass and createGatewayServiceResource actions
   - Solution: Update controller action chain to create Istio GatewayClass and Gateway service resources
   - Status: PROBLEM_5.md created for investigation and resolution
